Work until they can’t ignore you
Nobody cares — work harder
Be obsessed or be average
Dreams don’t work unless you do
Discipline beats motivation
Why Be Normal When You Can Be The Best
NEVER DIM YOUR LIGHT TO MAKE OTHERS COMFORTABLE
OBSESSION = EVERYTHING YOU DESIRE
It's okay to be unbalanced. Balanced people are the ones who never achieved anything
Surround yourself with people who want to reach for the stars with you, not those who are digging their own grave
Ordinary choices create ordinary lives
The price of success is paid in silence
Either you control your mind, or it controls you
Some bridges are worth burning if they lead you nowhere
Be easy to find, but hard to reach
